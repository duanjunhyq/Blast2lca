makeTree.pl (Feb 2011) README file

makeTree.pl is a tool designated to parse the output of the blast2lca program to have a first preliminary global analysis of the results.

Its output is a taxonomic tree in HTML (+CSS +JavaScript). You can
open this tree with any web browser. It uses different font sizes and
colors in leafs to denote different relative abundance of each taxon in each level.

To run the script:

$ perl makeTree.pl tax.lca > tax.html
